    # - :subquery - Creates a nested query with all joins, wrapped by a
    #               WHERE IN query.
    # - :left_join - Calls the joins directly using `left_joins`, and
    #                ensures records are unique using `distinct`. Note that
    #                `distinct` is not reliable in some cases. See

  # you're setting the permission for, the second one is the class of object you're setting it on.
  #
  #   can :update, Article
  #
  # You can pass an array for either of these parameters to match any one.
  # Here the user has the ability to update or destroy both articles and comments.
  #
  #   can [:update, :destroy], [Article, Comment]
  #
  # You can pass :all to match any object and :manage to match any action. Here are some examples.
  #
  #   can :manage, :all
  #   can :update, :all
  #   can :manage, Project
  #
  # You can pass a hash of conditions as the third argument. Here the user can only see active projects which he owns.
  #
  #   can :read, Project, :active => true, :user_id => user.id
  #
  # See ActiveRecordAdditions#accessible_by for how to use this in database queries. These conditions
  # are also used for initial attributes when building a record in ControllerAdditions#load_resource.
  #
  # If the conditions hash does not give you enough control over defining abilities, you can use a block
  # along with any Ruby code you want.
  #
  #   can :update, Project do |project|
  #     project.groups.include?(user.group)
  #   end
  #
  # If the block returns true then the user has that :update ability for that project, otherwise he
  # will be denied access. The downside to using a block is that it cannot be used to generate
  # conditions for database queries.
  #
  # You can pass custom objects into this "can" method, this is usually done with a symbol
  # and is useful if a class isn't available to define permissions on.
  #
  #   can :read, :stats
  #   can? :read, :stats # => true

  # IMPORTANT: Neither a hash of conditions nor a block will be used when checking permission on a class.

  #
  # Nested resources can be passed through a hash, this way conditions which are
  # dependent upon the association will work when using a class.
  #
  #   can? :create, @category => Project
  #
  # You can also pass multiple objects to check. You only need to pass a hash
  # following the pattern { :any => [many subjects] }. The behaviour is check if
  # there is a permission on any of the given objects.
  #
  #   can? :create, {:any => [Project, Rule]}

  # Sets up a before filter which authorizes the resource using the instance variable.
  # For example, if you have an ArticlesController it will check the @article instance variable

  # something like the following.
  #
  #   authorize!(params[:action].to_sym, @article || Article)
  #
  # Call this method directly on the controller class.
  #
  #   class BooksController < ApplicationController

  # Options:
  # [:+only+]
  #   Only applies before filter to given actions.

  # [:+except+]
  #   Does not apply before filter to given actions.
  #
  # [:+singleton+]
  #   Pass +true+ if this is a singleton resource through a +has_one+ association.
  #
  # [:+parent+]
  #   True or false depending on if the resource is considered a parent resource.
  #   This defaults to +true+ if a resource name is given which does not match the controller.
  #
  # [:+class+]
  #   The class to use for the model (string or constant). This passed in when the instance variable is not set.
  #   Pass +false+ if there is no associated class for this resource and it will use a symbol of the resource name.
  #
  # [:+instance_name+]
  #   The name of the instance variable for this resource.
  #
  # [:+through+]
  #   Authorize conditions on this parent resource when instance isn't available.
  #

  #
  # [:+through+]
  #   Load this resource through another one. This should match the name of the parent instance variable or method.
  #
  # [:+through_association+]
  #   The name of the association to fetch the child records through the parent resource.
  #   This is normally not needed because it defaults to the pluralized resource name.
  #
  # [:+shallow+]
  #   Pass +true+ to allow this resource to be loaded directly when parent is +nil+. Defaults to +false+.
  #
  # [:+singleton+]
  #   Pass +true+ if this is a singleton resource through a +has_one+ association.
  #
  # [:+parent+]
  #   True or false depending on if the resource is considered a parent resource.
  #   This defaults to +true+ if a resource name is given which does not match the controller.
  #
  # [:+class+]
  #   The class to use for the model (string or constant).
  #
  # [:+instance_name+]
  #   The name of the instance variable to load the resource into.
  #
  # [:+find_by+]
  #   Find using a different attribute other than id. For example.
  #
  #     load_resource :find_by => :permalink # will use find_by_permalink!(params[:id])
  #
  # [:+id_param+]
  #   Find using a param key other than :id. For example:
  #
  #     load_resource :id_param => :url # will use find(params[:url])
  #
  # [:+collection+]
  #   Specify which actions are resource collection actions in addition to :+index+. This
  #   is usually not necessary because it will try to guess depending on if the id param is present.
  #
  #     load_resource :collection => [:sort, :list]
  #
  # [:+new+]
  #   Specify which actions are new resource actions in addition to :+new+ and :+create+.

  #   fetch one.
  #
  #     load_resource :new => :build
