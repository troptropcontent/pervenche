This is the source code of my personnal project Pervenche wich is no more online. 

This application was allowing parisian vehicle owner to automaticaly renew there Ã¢rking ticket to avoid fines: 

I had to shut it down because Paris regulation changed on September first, it xhanged in the way that all electric scooter can now park anywhere without the need of a 'free ticket', so i lost 90 % of my customer in a day. 

Through its 4 months of activity the application gathered 90 daily active users, a max pace of 800 ticket taken everyday and a total amount of 62 000 tickets taken by the system. 

I did a meetup a few months ago to explain how i did, the video is [here]([url](https://youtu.be/ERLdFyoEL-A?si=bXLq_K8wgkWKBK_-)https://youtu.be/ERLdFyoEL-A?si=bXLq_K8wgkWKBK_-)
